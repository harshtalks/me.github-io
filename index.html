                <p class="about">
                    It all started with my interest in Web development (mostly frontend) back when I was in 10th grade.
                    Also School kills your creativity, Yes it does. I used to make wordpress websites for local ventures. Then one of my friends introduced me to
                    a local wed developer who helped me learn fundametals of frontend development. He was cool and also very short. 10th grader me was taller than him LOL. 
                </p>
                <p class="about">
                    At the beginning, I wasn't so sure if I would actually love the idea of leaving developer friendly experience wordpress as a CMS provides and shift to the 
                    HTML and CSS. but then thanks to cute websites I've got to see on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards</a> and it really fascinated me. I just wanted to explore every aspect of frontend development.
                    So this is how I got myself into the world of Web Spaces. and most importantly, It does make me happy because this is something I wanted to do and here I am, doing what exactly I wanted myself to engage with.

                <p class="about">
                    Currently persuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering in Specialization with Business System, It's definitely going to help me
                    engross in internet business, the functions that drive it while handling the technical domain. as I said, I code too.I Started with C, C++, Data Structure and Algorithm and now exploring python. 
                </p>
                <p class="about">I love statistics too. I feel like this is the only branch of mathematics which i embrace the most. Book titled as Naked Statistics is the best I've ever read. Also this is the only book I've read excluding every ncert book I was forced to read.
                    Imagine being in a cirlce where you're the only person who knows how to get sexy things done, like making netflix recommendation system most effective. predicition about United States's wealth distribution in future. This is what makes you look cool at the party.
                </p>
                <p class="about">Okay, I think I should shut up about my technical skills and talk about myself a little more. So I like Indie Music, something I talk about all the time. And before you ask what is something that I like to do when I'm alone, It's a Slow Dance on Niall Horan's Slow Hands
                    . Bro that song still slaps. I spend my time on social media a lot. I like talking to new people. Omegle era was so much fun and I made so many international friends. LOL I really don't know how could I actually put that in more nicer way.
